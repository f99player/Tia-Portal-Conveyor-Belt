# Tia-Portal-Conveyor-Belt
Project for using a basic training conveyor belt in unity and to send output to Tia Portal
You'll need 6 bool variables in Tia Portal to be able to use it correctly.
First 4 are for recieving info when a sensor detects the puck and the the other two are for the conveyor belt.
The fist conveyor belt bool controls whether or not the belt works, the second one controls it's direction
